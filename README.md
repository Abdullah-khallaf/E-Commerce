# E-Commerce Website

## What I am building
In this Project iam working on my skills as a front-end developer.</br>
Building E-Commerce website is a great way to to do that as i am working on these points:
1. OOP in JS.
2. building Components in JS. 
3. ASYNC and how to deal with data and Apies.
4. Authentication.
5. Testing and performance.

## Things in consideration:
I am working on this project in parallel with studying the Vuejs framework with Sarah drasner [Vue3 course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/vue-3/)
